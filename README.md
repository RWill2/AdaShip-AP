<h1>AdaShip - Advanced Programming</h1>
<h3>By Rebeca Williams</h3>

AdaShip is similar to the well known Battleships game. By default it is a 2 player game where each player takes turns in trying to elimenate the other players boats. To win the game you must destroy/sink all of your opponents boats.

For a default game each player has 2 10x10 boards. One will be used for your ships, this is known as a shipboard and is where you will place you ships as well as hits made by your opponent. The other board is known as the targetboard. This is where you can keep track of where you have fired and if it was a hit or a miss. Locations on the boards will have a single notation coordinate system which is made up of an alphabetic letter fr the colums and a number for the row e.g. A3.

There are 5 ships that come in various sizes. They all need to be placed on the shipboard before the game can be played. They can be placed horizontally or vertically but must remain wthin the bounds of the board and cannot cross another ship already on the board.
